Dr. Kalam \\nis a pioneer in fibre glass technology and led a young team to \\ninitiate this effort in ISRO from design, development leading to \\nproduction of composite s rocket motor cases . Dr. Kalam made \\nsignificant contribution a s Project Director to develop India’s \\nfirst indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV -3) which \\nsuccessfully injected the Rohini satellite in the near earth orbit \\nin July 1980 and made India an exclusive member of Space \\nClub.  \\nHe was responsible for the evolu tion of ISRO\\'s launch \\nvehicle programme, particularly the PSLV configuration. After \\nworking for two decades in ISRO and mastering launch vehicle \\ntechnologies, Dr. Kalam took up the responsibility of \\ndeveloping Indigenous Guided Missiles at Defence Research  \\nand Development Organisation as the Chief Executive of \\nIntegrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP). \\nHe was responsible for the development and operationalisation \\nDr. APJ Abdul Kala m \\nwww.abdulkalam.com  \\nPage 2 of 5 of AGNI and PRITHVI Missiles and for building indigenous \\ncapability in critical t echnologies through networking of \\nmultiple institutions. One of his significant contribution was \\ncreating Research Centre Imarat for advanced technologies. He \\nwas the Scientific Adviser to Defence Minister and Secretary, \\nDepartment of Defence Research & De velopment from July \\n1992 to December 1999. During this period he led to the \\nweaponisation of strategic missile systems and the Pokhran -II \\nnuclear tests in collaboration with Department of Atomic \\nEnergy, which made India a nuclear weapon State. He also \\ngave thrust to self -reliance in defence systems by progressing \\nmultiple development tasks and mission projects such as \\nLight Combat Aircraft.  \\nAs Chairman of Technology Information, Forecasting and \\nAssessment Council (TIFAC) and as an eminent scientist, he \\nled the country with the help of 500 experts to arrive at \\nTechnology Vision 2020 giving a road map for transforming \\nIndia from the present developing status to a developed \\nnation. Dr. Kalam has served as the Principal Scientific \\nAdvisor to the Government of In dia, in the rank of Cabinet \\nMinister, from November 1999 to November 2001 and was \\nresponsible for evolving policies, strategies and missions for \\nmany development applications.

Kalam -Raju cardiac \\nstent after quali fication trials has been fitted to many needy \\npatients.  This development has further led to the creation of a \\nproduction unit of state -of-the-art stents. Also, he had \\ninitiated the use of carbon -carbon and carbon -polymer \\nmaterials for production of floor reaction orthosi s calipers  \\nwhich has reduced the weight of the caliper to 1/10th of the \\noriginal weight during 1995 – 1996. Over 50,000 children have \\nbeen fitted with these calipers.  \\nDr. Kalam took up academic pursuit as Professor, \\nTechnology & Societal T ransformation at Anna University, \\nChennai from November 2001 and was involved in teaching \\nand research tasks. Above all he took up a mission to ignite \\nthe young minds for national development by meeting school \\nstudents across the country.  During the last d ecade, Dr. \\nKalam has addressed over five million youth below the age of \\n17 and inspired them to become an active participant of India \\nVision 2020.  He has addressed several children science \\ncongresses across the country.  \\nDr. Kalam is passionate about brin ging rural prosperity \\nthrough PURA (Providing Urban Amenities to Rural Areas), in \\nwhich science and technology has to play a key role.
